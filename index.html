<p> <b> Imagine Dragons </b>  - an indie rock band that includes four people. Was founded in Las Vegas in 2008. The name of the group is an anagram,
meaning only the members of the group know. The history of the band began with the fact that Daniel Reynolds attracted his friend and comrade
by college drummer Andrew Tolman, who, in turn, invited his wife Brittany Tolman (keyboards and backing vocals) and Daniel (Wayne) Sermon, who
perfectly played the guitar. The group quickly gained popularity. And already in Las Vegas, Dan and Wayne were joined by bassist Benjamin (Ben) McKee, who was invited by Wayne.
In 2010, Andrew and Brittany reported leaving the group to create a family. Then Ben McKee invited a group of drummer Daniil (Platz) Platzman.
Later, they joined Aurora Florence, replacing Brittany, and after her departure - Teresa Flaminio. After Teresa's departure, the group's composition did not change any more.

In early 2009, the musicians started working in the studio. And already on February 1 released their first mini-album Imagine Dragons. And on April 1 next year the light saw their mini-album
Hell and Silence (in the recording participated nominee "Grammy" Mark Needham). Both albums were recorded in the recording studio Battle Born Studios.
Soon they were invited to perform at the annual festival Bite of Las Vegas, as the "Most Wanted Group 2010" at the local 107.9FM.
They were chosen as headliners at the Vegas Music Summit, and the Las Vegas CityLife newspaper called them "a band that needs to be seen live".
According to the newspaper Las Vegas Weekly, they became the "Best Indie Group of 2010", and were also awarded the "Best Record of 2011" from the magazine Vegas Seven.
In November 2011, Imagine Dragons signed a contract with the American record label Interscope Records. They worked closely with producer Alex Da Kid, with whom
they recorded their first CD in West Hollywood. Their EP was named Continued Silence and released on February 14, 2012. To release their debut album
Imagine Dragons prepared very carefully. "By releasing the EP series, we probed the ground. We wanted our debut album to be successful, "Wayne confessed in an interview. </p>
